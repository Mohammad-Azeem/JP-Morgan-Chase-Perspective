# JP-Morgan-Chase-Perspective
The trader would like to be able to monitor two historically correlated stocks and be able to visualise when the correlation between the two weakens (i.e. one stock moves proportionally more than the historical correlation would imply). This could indicate a potential trade strategy to simultaneously buyÂ the relatively underperforming stock and sell the relatively outperforming stock. Assuming the two prices subsequently converge, the trade should be profitable.  Most data visualization for traders of JPMorgan is built on JPMorgan Chase's Perspective data visualization software.
